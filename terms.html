          <p>By using Chatsy's passkey system, users consent to the storage and usage of their credential ID for authentication purposes only.</p>

          <p>In the settings section of their Chatsy account, users have the option to:</p>

          <ul>
              <li><strong>Delete Passkey:</strong> Users can delete their passkey at any point.</li>
          </ul><p>For further information or assistance regarding passkey usage, please refer to our <strong><a href="s.html">support page</a></strong>.</p></li>
        </ul>
